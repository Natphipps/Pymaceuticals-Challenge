# Pymaceuticals-Challenge
Module 5 challenge

In-class activities:
In the code for this challenge I used the in-class activities to help me with syntax for cells 2-5 to merge and display data.
The in-class activities also helped me with creating figures in cells  12-13. Additionally, I created titles for each figure, labeling them 1-6. While this wasn't needed for the assignment, I did this to help identify them in the summary.

Outside Resources:
I found the .isin function from statology to drop the duplicated mouse ID in cell 6. 
The website SparkbyExamples was used to help me with the aggregate function I used in cell 9.

Tutoring help:
My tutor Saad Khan helped me with some errors I was having in my PyPlot section of the homework. He also aided me in the Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplot section. We went over how to calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse, and how to merge it into the original data frame. He helped me create the for loop to calculate the IQR, generate the boxplot, line plot, scatter plot, and correlation plot. We used outside resources for the linregress function (cell 19) and the flierprops=flierprops in the boxplot (cell 16).
